PARSING
-------
Input flags are parsed using flag.parse() from Golang's flag package and placed into a set of variables.
We parse data from the -data flag using a json decoder from Golang's json package.

STORING
-------
We use MongoDB to handle persistent storage.
Student data is decoded out of json and placed into a struct.
The struct is written into Mongo as a document.
If Mongo finds that it is inserting a duplicate, we raise an HTTP StatusConflict error.

SEARCHING
---------
We find students from the MongoDB database by building a query.
The query is a (k,v) map of (data fields, input search data).
Mongo processes this query and finds the requested stored data.
If the requested search is a listall, the input query is Nil, to which Mongo will return all data.
